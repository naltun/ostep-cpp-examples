These are my C++ implementations of code from the wonderful, free book,
[Operating Systems: Three Easy Steps](http://ostep.org).

The examples are originally written in C ([GitHub](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-code))
and my implementations are purely for the joy of learning.

As the example code is unlicensed, I am licensing my code under the terms of the
GPL-compatible, permissive WTFPL.
